# Avoiding common attacks

*A document called avoiding_common_attacks.md that explains what measures you took to ensure that your contracts are not susceptible to common attacks. (Module 9 Lesson 3)**

*Explain what measures youâ€™ve taken to ensure that your contracts are not susceptible to common attacks*

We consider the aspect and ideas below to ensure that the contract is secure against attack.

#### Reentrancy
We protect against [reentrancy](https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/known_attacks/) in two ways; using a proven design basic pattern and using a function modifier which enforces exclusive use of functions with a global mutex. 

The [withdrawal](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.24/common-patterns.html) design pattern is used for the withdrawFunds function, which in itself should protect against DAO-style reentrancy attacks. 

The function modifier "*nonReentrant*" is implemented which calls the ReentracyGuard contract before and after the modified function is called, setting and unsetting a global mutex "*reenrancy_lock*".

#### Overflow and Underflow
The OpenZepplin SafeMath library is used for all maths operations to prevent against underflow and overflow operations.


use audited code / libs
Overflow / underflow
Poison data - require conditions to check all input
All data is public
automated testing, testnet used

### Security Analysis with Mythril
We use [Mythril](https://mythx.io/) to check against certain contract [vulnerabilities](https://github.com/ConsenSys/mythril-classic/wiki/Mythril-Detection-Capabilities). The output is a the bottom of this file since it is lengthy.

The analysis reduces to two findings: 
1.  
```

### Areas for progress and improvement
The security of TB could be improved further by:
* *Bug bounty program* - a program to incentivise community 
Third party audit
